# CSS Basic Exercises

This folder contains the basic HTML and CSS exercises for the `alx_html_css` project. It's intended to demonstrate foundational CSS layout, selectors, and styling techniques.

Contents
 - `index.html` — Main practice page demonstrating basic layout and styles.
 - `tweets.html` — A small example page styled to look like simple tweet cards.
 - `base.css` — Base styles and resets used across the practice pages.
 - `styles.css` — Page-specific styles for `index.html` and `tweets.html`.

How to view
 - Open the folder in a browser by double-clicking `index.html` or `tweets.html`.
 - Or run a simple HTTP server from the `css_basic` directory:

	PowerShell:

	```powershell
	cd path\to\alx_html_css\css_basic;
	python -m http.server 8000
	```

	Then open `http://localhost:8000/index.html` in your browser.

Notes
 - Files are intentionally small and focused for learning CSS fundamentals.
 - Edit the CSS files and refresh the browser to see changes immediately.
