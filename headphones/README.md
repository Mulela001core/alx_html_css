# Fully Responsive Web Page Development (Completed Project)

In this project, I implemented a complete web page from scratch without using any external libraries. I applied all the HTML, CSS, accessibility, and responsive design knowledge that I had previously learned.

## Implementation Freedom

I was not given many instructions for the project. I had the freedom to design and build the page in the way I preferred.

## Project Objective

The main goal was clear: to create a fully functional web page that accurately matched the designer details.
